This is a basic web app demonstrating the JWT authentication system. 

Here i have used JWT (json web tokens) that are used to authenticate a user ( read more about jwt [here](https://jwt.io/introduction)

Mongodb is used as the database that handles the User model ( how the user details are going to look like)

I have also used Environment variables using dotenv to hide and secure keys/passwords.
